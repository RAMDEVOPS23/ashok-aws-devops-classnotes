ElasticBeanStack 
+++++++++++++++++++

-> ELastic Bean Stack Service will provide the platform  to run our application

	Here u no need to launch a VM, no need to install the server, no need to configure the securitygroup, no need to configure loadbalancing,autoscalling,vpc nothing
	whatever the infrastructure is required to run our application will be provided by ElasticBeanStack

	Cloud providers will provide the services in 3ways 
		1.IAAS
		2.PAAS
		3.SAAS

-> when u go for on-premises everything is to be managed  which is required to run ur application
-> when u go for IAAS service networking,storage,servers,virtualization will be provided by cloud provider u need to just manage the OS,middleware,runtime,data,applications
	as of now we did IAAS we launched a VM with OS, we are installing servers in that machine then we are running the application.
-> Their are some cloud providers who are providing PAAS services
   PAAS service means they will provide u everything which is required for ur application to run u just develop the project and give that project to cloud provider then they will run ur project
   If iam not interested to do on my own i will concentrate only on application development whatever the infrastructure is required for my application cloud provider will provide i will focus only on my project then u will go for PAAS
-> when u go for SAAS service means if i dont want to do anything  evrything i want somebody to provide like ZOOM software
